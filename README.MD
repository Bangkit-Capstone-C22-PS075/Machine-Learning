# **Machine Learning**

Here we do classification for clothing, especially upper body clothing. We classify the clothing to 12 class:

*   0 blouse
*   1 coat
*   2 jacket
*   3 long + wedding dress
*   4 polo/sport shirt + jersey, t-shirt
*   5 shirt
*   6 short dress
*   7 suit
*   8 sweater
*   9 kebaya
*   10 uniform
*   11 vest

Steps:
1.  Preprocess the Dataset ad data cleaning
3.  Do the training analyze the result for better performance and accuracy
4.  Try other model design or changing the hyperparameter to find the best result
6.  Deploy the model to Android (Tensorflow Lite) or on Cloud (Tensorflow Serving)
